          <p class="muted">Effective Date: <strong>[10/04/2025]</strong> &nbsp; • &nbsp; Last Updated: <strong>[10/04/2025]</strong></p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how BMBK Games (“we,” “us,” “our”) collects, uses, and protects personal information when you play MONSTER WAR (the “Game”) and use its related online services.
<br>
We respect your privacy and comply with applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other local regulations where applicable.
<br><br>

<br>
We collect only the information necessary to provide and improve our services.
<br>
1.1. Automatically Collected Information
<br>
When you play or connect to MONSTER WAR, we may automatically collect:
<br>

<br>
IP address – used for communication, region detection, and fraud prevention.
<br>
Steam ID or platform account ID – used to verify ownership and provide access to the Game.
<br>
1.2. Account Information (Non-Steam Accounts)
<br>
If you create an in-game account independent from Steam, we may collect:
<br>
Username, email address (if provided), and an internal user ID.
<br>
Encrypted password (never stored in plain text).
<br>
Gameplay data associated with your account, such as progress, statistics, and inventory.

Game version, language, and crash/error logs.
<br>
Gameplay telemetry and anonymous analytics to improve performance and balance.
<br>
We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data (such as real names, payment details, or physical addresses).
<br><br>
2. How We Use the Data
<br>
We use your information to:
<br>
Authenticate your access to the Game and verify license ownership.
<br>
Provide and maintain online features such as multiplayer, leaderboards, and cloud saves.
<br>
Detect and prevent cheating, fraud, or unauthorized access.
<br>
Analyze gameplay and improve performance, stability, and user experience.
<br>
Comply with applicable laws and enforce our End User License Agreement (EULA).
<br><br>
3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
<br>
We do not sell or rent your personal information.<br>
We may share limited data only in the following cases:
<br>
With Steam (Valve Corporation) — to support authentication, multiplayer, and store features.
<br>
With service providers — such as hosting, analytics, or anti-cheat providers, who process data on our behalf under confidentiality obligations.
<br>
With authorities — if required by law or to protect our legal rights.
<br>
All third-party partners are required to process data securely and only for authorized purposes.
<br>
4. Data Storage and Retention
<br>
Your data is stored securely on servers located in the Russian Federation.
<br>
We retain your data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy.
<br>
You may request deletion of your in-game account and associated data (see Section 7).
<br><br>
5. Security
<br>
We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information, including encryption, access restrictions, and secure transmission protocols.
<br>
However, no system is completely secure. You acknowledge that you use online services at your own risk.
<br><br>
6. Children’s Privacy
<br>
MONSTER WAR is not intended for children under 13 years of age.<br>
We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If we learn that data was collected from a child, we will promptly delete it.

We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your information according to applicable laws.
